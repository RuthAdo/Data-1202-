## Project Title

Data Cleaning and Exploration

### Short Description
This project involves a Python script for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a cereal dataset. It uses data wrangling techniques to clean the data, followed by visualizations and statistical analysis to uncover insights into the nutritional content, ratings, and attributes of different cereal brands, providing useful information for consumers and manufacturers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Refer to the deployment section for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Python 3.8 or higher**: The programming language required to run the scripts. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate numerical tables and time series.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations. It supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library. It provides tools for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

You can install these packages using pip, Python's package installer.

### Installing

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine to create a local copy of the repository.
   - Command:
     ```bash
     git clone <https://github.com/>
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change your current directory to the location where the repository was cloned.
     ```bash
     cd <data1202>
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install the required Python packages using pip. Command:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
     ```

5. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook to open the `.ipynb` file:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

### Running the Tests

Automated tests ensure that the code runs as expected. Here's a breakdown of the types of tests included and how to run them:

#### Breakdown of Tests

- **Unit Tests**: These tests focus on individual functions or modules to verify their correctness. They help in identifying and fixing bugs at an early stage. Example: Testing functions for handling missing values or correcting data types.

  - Command to run unit tests:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```

- **End-to-End Tests**: These tests cover the entire workflow from data loading to final analysis and visualization. They ensure that all parts of the system work together seamlessly and produce the expected results. Example: Running the notebook and verifying the output of the data cleaning and EDA steps.

  - Typically involves executing the main script and verifying the outputs manually or through additional automated checks.

#### Coding Style Tests

- **PEP8 Compliance**: These tests ensure that the code follows the Python style guidelines (PEP8). Maintaining a consistent coding style is important for readability and maintainability of the codebase.

  - Command to check PEP8 compliance:
    ```bash
    flake8 script.py
    ```

### Main Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository performs several key steps in data cleaning and exploration:

1. **Loading the Data**:
   - The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
   - Example: `df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv')`

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Strategies such as filling with mean/median or dropping missing values. Missing values can significantly affect the results of data analysis.
   - **Correcting Data Types**: Ensuring that numerical data is in the correct format. This step is crucial for performing accurate calculations and analyses.
   - **Removing Duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate rows to avoid skewing the analysis.
   - **Renaming Columns**: Making column names more readable and consistent. This improves the clarity and understanding of the data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Generating summary statistics for numerical columns to get an overview of the data distribution.
   - **Data Visualization**: Creating plots to visualize distributions, correlations, and other important patterns in the data. This includes histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and more.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationships between different variables using correlation matrices and heatmaps. This helps in identifying potential correlations and causations.

4. **Insights and Conclusions**:
   - **Summarizing Key Findings**: Highlighting the main insights derived from the EDA.
   - **Patterns or Trends**: Identifying and discussing any notable patterns or trends observed in the data.
   - **Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, providing actionable recommendations or next steps.

### Deployment

To deploy this project on a live system, follow these additional steps:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites are Met**:
   - Verify that the live system has Python installed and all required dependencies are met.

2. **Transfer Project Files**:
   - Copy the project files to the live system using file transfer tools like `scp`, `rsync`, or any other method.

3. **Set Up Virtual Environment**:
   - On the live system, create and activate a virtual environment, then install the dependencies as described in the "Installing" section.

4. **Verify Dataset Availability**:
   - Ensure the dataset file is present and accessible in the project directory on the live system.

5. **Run the Main Script**:
   - Execute the main script to start the data analysis process. Monitor the outputs to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
